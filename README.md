## Introduction

Understanding neural networks is crucial in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This repository provides a comprehensive guide and implementation of neural networks without relying on external libraries, allowing you to grasp the fundamental concepts from the ground up.

## Features

- **Modularity:** The code is organized in a modular fashion, making it easy to understand and extend. Each component of the neural network, such as layers, activation functions, and loss functions, is implemented separately.

- **Flexibility:** The architecture is designed to be flexible, enabling you to experiment with different network structures, activation functions, and optimization techniques easily.

- **Educational:** Extensive comments and documentation are provided throughout the code, explaining each step and concept. This makes the repository an excellent educational resource for those new to neural networks.

- **Visualization:** Visualize the training process, including loss and accuracy metrics, to gain insights into how the network is learning.
